<script type="text/html" data-help-name="Read File">
<p>The Read File node reads the contents of a file and outputs the file content as a message payload. It offers various output modes and file encoding options to handle different file types and sizes efficiently.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<h4>Basic Settings</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Node name that will be displayed in the flow.</li>
    <li><b>Filename</b>: Path to the file to be read. Can be a static path, a value from <code>msg.filename</code>, or an environment variable.</li>
    <li><b>Encoding</b>: Character encoding of the file. Choose from a wide range of encodings or use the default system encoding.</li>
    <li><b>Buffer Size</b>: Size of the buffer used for reading the file (in bytes). Default is 65536 bytes (64 KB).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Output Mode</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Output a single UTF-8 string</b>: Reads the entire file as a string in one message.</li>
    <li><b>Output line by line</b>: Reads the file line by line and outputs each line as a separate message.</li>
    <li><b>Output a single Buffer object</b>: Reads the entire file as a binary buffer in one message.</li>
    <li><b>Output Buffer object stream</b>: Outputs the file as a stream of buffer chunks.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Line Output Options</h4>
<p>When using the "Output line by line" mode, you can choose:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Output Format</b>:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Single output</b>: Outputs each line as a separate message.</li>
            <li><b>Batch output</b>: Outputs multiple lines at once as an array.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Maximum lines per batch</b>: When using Batch output, defines the maximum number of lines in each batch.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Flow Control</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Enable/Disable</b>: Enables or disables flow control for managing large file processing.</li>
    <li>When enabled, you must use a "Flow Control" node to control the reading speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>msg.filename <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>If the filename type is set to <code>msg</code>, the node will read the file specified in this property.</dd>
    <dt>msg.payload.filename <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>Alternative location for the filename if <code>msg.filename</code> is not provided.</dd>
    <dt>msg.env <span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
    <dd>If the filename type is set to <code>env</code>, the node will use this environment variable map.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Outputs</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>msg.payload <span class="property-type">string | buffer | array</span></dt>
    <dd>The content of the file, formatted according to the output mode selection.</dd>
    <dt>msg.atomicSession <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>When flow control is enabled, contains the session ID for flow control management.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The Read File node is designed to handle files of various sizes efficiently. For small files, you can use the single output modes to get the entire content at once. For larger files, line-by-line or buffer stream modes with flow control can prevent memory issues.</p>

<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>When reading large files with "single" output modes, there's a risk of running out of memory. For large files, it's recommended to use the streaming or line-by-line modes.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>[{"id":"863b5fcfc2c5ca42","type":"inject","z":"c781ad444e961c1f","name":"","props":[{"p":"payload"},{"p":"topic","vt":"str"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","x":250,"y":280,"wires":[["c5a17985f819468a"]]},

<p>This example demonstrates reading a file line by line with flow control. Each line is output to the debug node, and the Flow Control node manages the reading pace.</p>
